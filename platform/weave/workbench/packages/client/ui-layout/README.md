English | [中文](README.zh.md)


The Workbench frame marks its product presentation so detail and navigation styling can follow its layout without changing other profiles.

## Summary

The optional `shell.access` entry reports an account identity through `onAccessChange`. Workbench withholds every business view until that entry grants access and unmounts the entire business tree when it withdraws access. Other build profiles keep the existing direct shell composition. No React content crosses this callback; layout retains its column and child-slot ownership.

This package provides the shell layout of the Web GUI: a three-column AppFrame with resizable sidebar and details panels, a concession chain that shrinks the details column and then auto-closes it when space runs out, and the `ctx.layout` panel-geometry service other plugins call to open or close the details column. It also seats the theme presenter, which projects the resolved color scheme, alias tokens, content font size, and `theme-color` metadata onto the document. Choose it for the standard window chrome; Workbench retains the scene width while panel open state resets on reload.

The shell also declares the optional `useHostManagement` projection and `startPersonalSession` command. The account-owning product supplies them as root standard sources; generic UI packages consume this contract without importing account implementation. Workbench hides Host management when the projection is absent. Other build profiles retain their existing navigation.

## Use this package

Mount this plugin at the root slot to render navigation, conversation, and details. Workbench opens the conversation and work scene at an initial 40/60 ratio when the content area has at least 900px: conversation retains at least 420px and the scene at least 480px, before their internal padding. Drag the separator or use its left/right arrow keys to resize; the last scene width survives close and reload. Limited space first collapses navigation to its 56px rail, then switches between conversation and scene without an overlay. Explicit focus mode fills the content area; ordinary opening restores the split. Both content trees remain mounted; hidden views are excluded from keyboard and assistive navigation. Other profiles retain the standard details concession chain.

### Theme presentation

The presenter consumes resolved theme snapshots and projects them onto the document: `html { color-scheme }` for native UA chrome, `body[data-ds-dark-theme]` from the active color scheme, the theme's alias tokens and `--dsh-content-font-size` as inline variables on body, and one owned `<meta name="theme-color">` whose content follows the computed body background. Disposing the presenter removes its metadata node with its other global writes.

## Understand the implementation

<details>
<summary>Implementation internals — click to expand</summary>

One `register()` call contributes `AppFrame` into the runtime's built-in `'root'` slot and, in the same breath, declares the five child slots (`shell.access`, `sidebar`, `conversation`, `details`, `shell.overlay`), seats the layout store (panel geometry), and wires the `ctx.layout` panel-action service. The layout store starts the sidebar at its default width and details closed. Workbench stores only its user-dragged scene width under `weave.workbench.detailsWidth`; storage failures leave the current layout usable. After account access is granted, AppFrame keeps the conversation and details columns mounted; a connected Session renders through `SessionProvider`. It projects the selected Session title over the build-configured product title or the localized `common.brand.localBuild` fallback, so locale revisions update document metadata with the root entry. The theme presenter is a second effect: pure DOM writes from resolved snapshots — initial state through the getter once, then event-driven only, with no React path. It applies palette, font-size, and token variables before measuring the rendered background as the single color authority.

## Further Exploration

Read these pages when the layout surface is not enough. They move from the frame to the columns it renders and the theme it presents.

- [ui-sidebar](../ui-sidebar/README.md) — occupies the `sidebar` column and its seats.
- [ui-conversation](../ui-conversation/README.md) — occupies the `conversation` and `details` columns.
- [ui-theme](../ui-theme/README.md) — the theme seam whose resolved snapshots the presenter consumes.
- [Web client architecture](../../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-07-19-gui-web-client-architecture.md) — how browser plugin rows load and register slots.

## Model Experience

None, as the layout shell manages browser viewing state; nothing here reaches a model request.

#### KV Cache effect

None; this package neither assembles nor sends a provider request.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>


These limits define the current layout behavior. They are current package constraints, not a general window-manager comparison or a task backlog.

- **Open state is transient** — reload and switching to another Session close details. Workbench retains its preferred scene width; other profiles reset it. Unselected surfaces render details at zero width without modifying geometry.
- **Concession-chain auto-close derives a zero width without touching the preferred width** — the panel restores itself when the window widens; consumers must not read the stored details width as the rendered truth.
- **No scroll anchoring during squeeze reflow** — layout changes may move the reader's viewport.
