# Validation guide

This page explains how to reproduce and interpret GooeyPi's validation gates. It is not a status report. A passing command or workflow is evidence only for the exact commit, runner, inputs, and credentials that produced it; do not infer that the current branch is green from this document.

## Protected `main` validation contract

The repository's `main` branch protection must require pull requests and require status checks to pass with **Require branches to be up to date before merging** enabled (`required_status_checks.strict: true`). This strict latest-main requirement prevents a PR from merging on a newer base than the integration state validated by CI.

The required checks are exactly the seven normal pull-request gates:

- `production-audit`
- `quality`
- `hermetic-e2e`
- `windows-state-migration`
- `packaging-smoke (macos-14, mac, arm64, --config.mac.identity=null)`
- `packaging-smoke (ubuntu-22.04, linux, x64)`
- `packaging-smoke (windows-2022, win, x64)`

Do not require `local-qa-package`: it is manual local QA, runs only through `workflow_dispatch`, and is intentionally excluded from pull-request validation.

`Production dependency audit` is a seventh pull-request gate: it runs the exception-aware `npm run audit:production` evaluator against the exact PR head, and the release workflow runs the same evaluator against its validated immutable SHA before any package or publication job. After the check context first appears on a pull request, a repository administrator must add `Production dependency audit` to the required status checks on `main`. The scheduled [dependency-audit workflow](../.github/workflows/audit.yml) remains for advisories disclosed after merge.

GitHub merge queues are not available to this public repository while it is owned by a personal account. Consequently, `merge_group` or a required merge queue cannot enforce this policy here; strict up-to-date branch protection is the supported latest-main control. If the repository moves to an organization, merge-queue support should be designed and tested separately before enabling it.

An authorized maintainer can verify the active legacy branch protection and exact required-context set with:

```sh
gh api repos/am-will/gooey-pi/branches/main/protection \
  --jq '{strict: .required_status_checks.strict, contexts: .required_status_checks.contexts, reviews: .required_pull_request_reviews}'
```

Read these files at the commit being validated. Job names, test inventory, dependency versions, budgets, and artifact matrices can change; copying their current values into a permanent pass/fail table would create another stale snapshot.

## Reproducible setup

The repository derives its Node and npm policy from checked-in metadata. `package.json#engines`, `package.json#packageManager`, and `.nvmrc` must agree; release entry points reject unsupported, malformed, or prerelease tool versions. With `nvm`, prepare a checkout as follows:

```bash
nvm install
nvm use
npm run toolchain:bootstrap
npm ci
npm run release:preflight:toolchain
```

Run `toolchain:bootstrap` before installing project dependencies. It installs the `packageManager`-pinned npm into the invoked npm's validated global prefix, verifies the exact installed JavaScript CLI with the active Node executable, and publishes the matching shim directory to later GitHub Actions steps. This is necessary because the npm bundled by `actions/setup-node` can be older than the repository's npm floor.

`npm ci` runs the shared `postinstall` entry point. That entry point installs Electron's platform runtime synchronously before asking Electron Builder to rebuild native dependencies, so parallel test workers do not race Electron's lazy downloader. Installing with `--ignore-scripts` intentionally skips both operations; follow the recovery sequence in the [source setup instructions](../README.md#run-from-source) before running or packaging the application.

Do not hard-code the current Node, npm, or Electron version in validation notes. Record the values observed for the tested commit instead.

## Pull-request and branch CI

The [CI workflow](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs on pull requests, pushes to `main`, and manual dispatch. Each Node job bootstraps the repository npm before `npm ci` and executes the toolchain-only release preflight after installation.

| Job | When it runs | What a pass establishes |
|---|---|---|
| `production-audit` | Pull request, `main`, manual dispatch | The exception-aware production dependency audit passes for the exact checked-out commit. |
| `quality` | Pull request, `main`, manual dispatch | TypeScript checks; configured lint and format checks; the coverage suite and thresholds; production bundle creation; bundle-size budgets; coverage artifact upload. |
| `hermetic-e2e` | Pull request, `main`, manual dispatch | The built application passes the Playwright Electron suite on the pinned macOS runner without relying on developer state. Failure artifacts are uploaded when available. |
| `windows-state-migration` | Pull request, `main`, manual dispatch | The state migration suite passes on a real `windows-2022` runner, including the production-platform fresh-install, migration, restart, and update path. Simulating `platform: 'win32'` on another OS is useful unit coverage but is not a substitute for this job. |
| `packaging-smoke` | Pull requests only | Native macOS arm64, Linux x64, and Windows x64 runners can build unpacked application directories. Linux and Windows additionally verify the ASAR layout and exact native-unpack allowlist. These are unsigned smoke builds, not public installers. |
| `local-qa-package` | Manual dispatch only | Native runners create and verify installable local-QA artifacts for macOS, Linux, and Windows, then upload the configured artifact set. These artifacts are not represented as signed or notarized public releases. |

Expected skips are part of this design:

- `local-qa-package` is expected to be skipped on pull requests and pushes to `main`.
- `packaging-smoke` is expected to be skipped on pushes to `main` and manual dispatches because its condition is pull-request-only.

`windows-state-migration` is required for every CI trigger listed above; a skip is not expected.

A green PR packaging matrix does not prove Developer ID signing, Apple notarization/stapling, Gatekeeper acceptance, Authenticode identity, installer integrity, or the complete public artifact matrix. Those belong to the release workflow.

## Local aggregate commands

Use focused tests while developing, then choose the aggregate that matches the claim you need to make. The command definitions in [`package.json`](../package.json) remain authoritative.

| Command | Scope |
|---|---|
| `npm run release:verify:package` | Toolchain preflight, typecheck, configured code checks, coverage tests, production bundle, and bundle-size gate. It does not create an installer or run Electron E2E. |
| `npm run release:verify` | The package-verification aggregate above plus the hermetic Electron E2E suite. |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Builds the application, then runs the hermetic Electron E2E suite. |
| `npm run audit:production` | Fetches npm's production audit report and applies the repository's high/critical advisory and exception policy. Network access is required. |
| `npm run package:mac:local-qa` | On macOS, runs the relevant verification aggregate, creates unsigned/unnotarized DMG and ZIP artifacts, and applies macOS post-package checks in QA mode. |
| `npm run package:linux:local-qa` | On Linux, runs the package-verification aggregate, creates the configured Linux artifacts, and verifies their runtime layout in QA mode. |
| `npm run package:win:local-qa` | On Windows, runs the package-verification aggregate, creates the configured Windows artifacts, and verifies their runtime layout in QA mode. |

Packaging is native: run each platform command on its matching operating system and architecture. The public `package:mac`, `package:linux`, and `package:win` commands use distribution mode; macOS and Windows distribution checks require their external signing configuration. A successful local-QA command must not be described as a public trust check.

## Dependency audit policy

The [dependency-audit workflow](../.github/workflows/audit.yml) runs weekly and on manual dispatch. It uses the repository toolchain and executes `npm run audit:production` against the production dependency graph. This scheduled job supplies advisory coverage for vendored package forms that Dependabot cannot parse.

Ordinary PR CI validates the exception file and its expiry rules, but it does not replace the live registry-backed audit. Use the scheduled or manually dispatched audit workflow when making a current dependency-advisory claim.

The project gate and raw npm output answer different questions:

- `npm audit --omit=dev` is the underlying registry report for the production lock graph. Its output and exit status are diagnostic and can change as the advisory database changes.
- `npm run audit:production` parses that report and fails on every unaccepted **high** or **critical** advisory.
- [`audit-exceptions.json`](../scripts/release/audit-exceptions.json) can accept an exact advisory/package pair only with a reason and expiry. The gate also fails expired exceptions and stale exceptions that no longer match the report.
- The ordinary release-script tests check exception structure and expiry, so an elapsed acceptance is visible in PR CI as well as in the weekly audit.

A passing audit therefore does not mean the production graph carries no known advisory: the gate also passes while an advisory is accepted in [`audit-exceptions.json`](../scripts/release/audit-exceptions.json) with a reason and an unexpired date. Never restate a passing gate as "zero vulnerabilities". Read that file for the accepted-risk position at the commit under review, and treat adding or extending an exception as a security-sensitive change governed by the [dependency pinning and supply-chain policy](security.md#dependency-pinning-and-supply-chain).

## Public release validation

The [release workflow](../.github/workflows/release.yml) runs for a semantic-version tag or a manual request naming an existing tag. It first verifies that the tag matches both package manifests and resolves to a commit on `main`; downstream jobs check out the resulting immutable commit SHA.

| Release job | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `validate` | Enforce the repository toolchain, validate tag/package versions and `main` ancestry, and expose the exact release SHA. |
| `production-audit` | Apply the exception-aware production dependency audit to that immutable SHA before any package job. |
| `quality` | Run `release:verify:package` for that SHA. |
| `hermetic-e2e` | Build and run the Electron E2E suite for that SHA. |
| `package` | Build both native macOS architectures. Credential preflight is fail-closed; public verification checks the signing identity, required microphone entitlements on the app and every Electron helper, the notarization staple on each packaged app, Gatekeeper, artifact integrity, fuses, native layout/architecture, and package budgets. |
| `package-linux` | Build the configured Linux architectures on native runners and apply the Linux package/runtime verification path. |
| `package-windows` | When explicitly enabled, build either Authenticode-signed public packages or unsigned beta packages. Signed mode requires signing secrets and the configured signer subject and/or thumbprint. |
| `release-packages` | Reject failed prerequisites, collect the enabled platform artifacts, generate checksums, attest provenance, and publish or resume the GitHub Release with write permission scoped to this final job. |

Native release jobs pass `--skip-verify` only after the same immutable SHA has passed the upstream quality and E2E jobs. That flag skips a duplicate pre-package test aggregate; it does not skip bundle creation or the platform-specific post-package verification.

Public macOS checks require external Developer ID and notarization credentials that are not present in ordinary PR CI. Signed Windows packaging is also conditional on repository configuration and secrets. If neither signed nor unsigned Windows release mode is enabled, `package-windows` is expected to be skipped and the aggregate release gate explicitly accepts that skip. Within an enabled Windows job, the signed and unsigned build steps are mutually exclusive, so one of them is normally skipped.

An explicitly enabled unsigned Windows beta is not trust-ready and must be labelled as such. Ordinary PR smoke packages and manual local-QA artifacts do not replace any credentialed release check.

## Recording evidence

Keep point-in-time results in the PR, release notes, or another commit-addressed record rather than updating this guide with a new "current status". Record at least:

- the full commit SHA and whether the worktree was clean;
- the workflow run URL or exact commands and exit status;
- runner image or local OS/architecture, plus observed Node and npm versions;
- workflow inputs and which conditional jobs or steps were skipped;
- the audit exception file used for dependency-audit claims;
- artifact names and checksums, and whether each artifact was unsigned, signed, notarized, stapled, or provenance-attested;
- any failure, rerun, accepted limitation, or manual observation needed to interpret the result.

Use test counts only inside that commit-addressed evidence. The durable claim is that the checked-in aggregate completed successfully, not that this guide remembers how many tests happened to exist at some earlier date.
